## Outline

Statistics Canada releases Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs) for the Census and many of its surveys. These de-identified files contain responses at the individual level and are a rich source of data for researchers.

This workshop demonstrates how to access, explore, and analyze Statistics Canada microdata using R. We will work with the [Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/canadian-tobacco-nicotine-survey.html){:target="_blank"} but the content applies to any Statistics Canada PUMF, hundreds of which are freely available in [Abacus](https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"}, UBC Libraryâ€™s data repository.

**There are no prerequisites.** Participants familiar with R and RStudio can follow along on their own workstations. For those new to R, the workshop showcases how R can be used for analysis and reproducibility.

If you are new to R and want to participate fully, please install R and RStudio before the workshop:

- Install R from <https://cran.rstudio.com/>{:target="_blank"}
- Install RStudio from <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>{:target="_blank"}
- <strong>Follow along and run the code in this <a href= "https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/r-microdata/content/r_microdata_outline.Rmd" target="_blank">R Markdown file</a>.</strong>


### Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Describe how microdata differs from statistics, and how it can be used
2. Find Statistics Canada Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs) in [Abacus](https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"}, UBC Library's data repository
3. Interpret PUMF documentation, including user guides and data codebooks
4. Appreciate how R can support your research process and improve reproducibility
